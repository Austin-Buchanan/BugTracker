# BugTracker

## Description
This is a web app written in PHP used to track software bugs. It operates similarly to a helpdesk ticketing system, allowing users to create entries for new bugs, add files such as screenshots, add work notes, and update with resolutions. 

The app was built on a local MySQL instance, although it can be extended for various relational database types. 

Here is a screen recording of the application in-action:
